# Courier-Kata

Question 5 has not been entirely completed within the time frame - the logic for finding the best combination of discounts. 
The final few bullets in the Kata were also not implemented such as outputting discounts separately. 

Future:
- I would have a more abstract solution in hindsight, implementing interfaces for methods such as the Parcel methods.
- I would also remove all magic numbers and have them in an easy to change location set against variables
- The tests would be more thorough testing for more cases
- Validation would be added for parcel dimensions & weight (no parcels with dimensions less than 0 etc)
